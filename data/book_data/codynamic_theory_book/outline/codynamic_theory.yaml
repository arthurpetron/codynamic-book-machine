  title: "Codynamic Theory: Structure Is All You Need"
  summary: |
    This book introduces Codynamic Theory: a framework for understanding learning, structure, and computation through recursive, context-aware evolution. Rooted in category theory and informed by embodied cognition, it presents a system of tools and structures for expressing, simulating, and iterating on reality-aligned systems.

  intent:
    audience: "Researchers in AI, physics, robotics, and mathematics; systems designers; advanced generalists"
    writing_style: "Technically expressive, rigorously grounded, intuitively scaffolded"
    author_persona: "An experienced theorist inviting others into a collaborative journey"
    reader_takeaway: "A deep, structural intuition for codynamic systems and the confidence to construct and evolve their own"
    genre: "Scientific treatise with applied philosophy and technical instruction"

  chapters:

      title: "Foundations of Structure"
      goal: "Introduce the codynamic viewpoint and why static models fail"
      summary: |
        Explore how traditional static models fall short in describing learning systems. Introduce intuitionism, structural recursion, and codynamic intent.
